"question": "A company uses AWS Organizations with a single OU named Production to manage multiple accounts. All accounts are members of the Production OU. Administrators use deny list SCPs in the root of the organization to manage access to restricted services. The company recently acquired a new business unit and invited the new unit’s existing AWS account to the organization. Once onboarded, the administrators of the new business unit discovered that they are not able to update existing AWS Config rules to meet the company’s policies. Which option will allow administrators to make changes and continue to enforce the current policies without introducing additional long-term maintenance?",

"question": "A company is running a two-tier web-based application in an on-premises data center. The application layer consists of a single server running a stateful application. The application connects to a PostgreSQL database running on a separate server. The application’s user base is expected to grow significantly, so the company is migrating the application and database to AWS. The solution will use Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, and Elastic Load Balancing. Which solution will provide a consistent user experience that will allow the application and database tiers to scale?",

"question": "A company uses a service to collect metadata from applications that the company hosts on premises. Consumer devices such as TVs and internet radios access the applications. Many older devices do not support certain HTTP headers and exhibit errors when these headers are present in responses. The company has configured an on-premises load balancer to remove the unsupported headers from responses sent to older devices, which the company identified by the User-Agent headers. The company wants to migrate the service to AWS, adopt serverless technologies, and retain the ability to support the older devices. The company has already migrated the applications into a set of AWS Lambda functions. Which solution will meet these requirements?",
